You (as a player) don't find out until later on in the game, but you play as a person
who lived a life with someone, with their own friends, family, just general life. But
something (you know what) happened to disconnect you emotionally from them.

After some time (almost like a callback to stardew), you decide to leave for another life, maybe
to heal and come back, maybe not and just to get away from it all (insert image of you
and a couple friends waving bye, they start to walk away, cut to you looking hesistant/
worries, cut back to one of the friends hanging back for a second, seeing that bout of anxiety,
but haphazardly continues.

Later on in the game, after you've gained the general populus as closer friends and get to know them, really
start to find yourself once again in a new home in this town, she comes back. Insert some apology/come back
with me kind of speech. Your face is beaming with excitement, everything can go back to before the bad
times that started this whole thing. You choose whether or not to do so and if you choose yes...you look back
at your friends here..."are you sure?".

Maybe end story there, enter kind of a new game+ deal or something. Maybe have that backstory for yourself
tie into the multiplayer aspect with your co-op partner in your world actually being a memory of your loved
one, you're just daydreaming of a better past.
